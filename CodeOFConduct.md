# Code of Conduct
As contributors and maintainers of the ChitaMitra project, we pledge to create a welcoming and respectful environment for all participants. We value the participation of every member of our community and strive to provide a positive and inclusive experience for everyone.

We expect all contributors and community members to uphold the following principles:

## Be Respectful
We value respectful and constructive communication between members of our community. We will not tolerate any form of harassment or discrimination, including but not limited to:

1. Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, race, religion, or political affiliation.
2. Deliberate intimidation or personal attacks.
3. Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Be Collaborative
We believe that collaboration is essential to the success of our project. We encourage constructive criticism and welcome feedback on all contributions. We also value the contributions of those who may not necessarily have the same expertise or opinions as other members of the community.

## Be Open-Minded
We recognize that our community is made up of individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences. We encourage open-mindedness and strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their opinions and ideas.

## Be Professional
We expect all members of our community to conduct themselves professionally. This includes refraining from any behavior that could be considered inappropriate or unprofessional, including but not limited to:

1. Discriminatory language or actions.
2. Sexual language or imagery.
3. Insults or personal attacks.
4. Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement
We take these principles seriously and will not tolerate any behavior that violates them. If you witness or experience any form of harassment or discrimination, or any other conduct that you believe is inappropriate or unprofessional, please report it to the project maintainers at [maintainers-email-address].

We will investigate any reports of misconduct and take appropriate action, which may include removing individuals from the project or community.
